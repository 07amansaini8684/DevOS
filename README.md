# ⚙️ Dev OS — AI Developer Workspace (Generative UI)

Dev OS is an AI-powered developer workspace built using a **generative UI approach** with Tambo.  
Instead of navigating complex dashboards, users interact using natural language — and the interface dynamically renders the right tools and components based on user intent.
